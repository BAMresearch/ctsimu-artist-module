+ Implement detector properties -> aRTist
	- Unsharpness mode, mtf10frequency, MTF file, long range unsharpness
	- efficiency (replaces sensitivity?)
	- SNR curve
	- Should a change in the beam current cause a detector-re-generation? (imin/imax mode) No -> be more explicit in JSON scenario documentation.

+ aRTist-specific JSON parameters

# Future
+ Materials manager / JSON: chemical composition: number fractions vs. mass fractions
+ Replace `json new` by `json` once aRTist has updated rl_json version.
