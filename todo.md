# Future
+ Replace `json new` by `json` once aRTist has updated rl_json version.
+ Extend classes with better setting, getting, adding and removing capabilities, so objects can be built easier within Tcl. At the moment, the classes mostly support reading JSON structures to set them up, because that's how the aRTist module is intended to be used. However, thinking about the reverse direction, it is conceivable that advanced users want to build a scenario within Tcl and export that scenario as a JSON file.
